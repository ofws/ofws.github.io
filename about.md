![ofws cv meetup](../images/cvmeetup.jpg)

[ofws](https://www.facebook.com/ofWorkshop/) is a work of [Reed Tothong](firmread.me), one half of [openFrameworks Workshop meetup](http://www.meetup.com/openframeworks/), we've offered free artist-run workshops in New York since 2014. We started as a small group of OF enthusiasts work closely to learn openFrameworks together.  


  

Another half of us has grown into [OF COURSE](http://ofcourse.io/) that is now based in Shanghai.
